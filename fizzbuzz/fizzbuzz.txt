 Print the Fizz Buzz numbers.

Fizz Buzz is a famous code challenge used in interviews to test basic programming skills. It's time to write your own implementation.
Print numbers from 1 to 100 inclusively following these instructions:

1) if a number is multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of this number,
2) if a number is multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of this number,
3) for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz",
4) print the rest of the numbers unchanged.

for i in range(1,100):
  if i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
    continue
  elif i%3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
    continue
  elif i%5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
    continue
  else:
    print(i)
