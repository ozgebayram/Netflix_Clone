The department you work for undertook a project construction that makes word / text analysis. You are asked to calculate the number of letters or any chars in the sentences entered under this project.
Write a Python program that;
takes a sentence from the user
counts the number of each letter/chars of the sentence,
collects the letters/chars as a key and the counted numbers as a value in a dictionary.

text = input()
dict = {}
for i in text:
    dict[i]= dict.get(i,0) + 1
print(dict)
